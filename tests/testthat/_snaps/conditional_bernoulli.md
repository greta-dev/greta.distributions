# conditional_bernoulli fails when given the wrong argument dimensions

    `p` must be a 2D array with at least two columns
    but `p` has dimensions 1x1

---

    `p` and `psi` must have the same number of rows
    But we see `p` and `psi` have:
    `p`: 1 row
    `psi`: 2 rows
    Perhaps you need to coerce `p` or `psi` to an appropriate matrix?

    `dim` must be a scalar positive integer, but was:
